    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <h2>What do you feed your fish?</h2>
    <h3>I primarily feed them brine shrimp that I hatch daily. I also feed them the veggie mix I sell and fancy guppy made by hikari.</h3>
    <h2>How often do you do waterchanges?</h2>
    <h3>This depends on many things, but I would say 20% per week would be sufficient for most aquariums. Factors that influence waterchanges are the amount of fish in the tank, how often you feed them and whether you have live plants. Live plants drastically reduce the required amount of waterchanges. You can check whether you need to do a waterchanges by measuring the nitrates in your water with a test kit, these can be found at most pet stores that sell aquarium fish and related products.</h3>
